## Requirements

Before you start, make sure you have a C compiler like GCC installed on your system. You can download and install it from MinGW's website.
However, if you already have a C environment setup, you can simply run the code there such as VSCode or even through online compilers. 


## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up and running the projects on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Cloning the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepositoryname.git
cd yourrepositoryname
```

### Running the Code

You can either run these programs in your local IDE or through an online compiler for ease of access. Either way, the code should work regardless.
